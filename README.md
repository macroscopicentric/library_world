##Library World

Text adventure based in fictional libraries. Play it online [here](http://obscure-lake-8329.herokuapp.com/library_world).

###Setting Information
The main library is the Clayr library from Garth Nix's Abhorsen trilogy. "The Charter" is just a fancy way of saying "magic."

###Available Commands
(You can also find these through the 'help' command in-game.)

* To move, use cardinal or ordinal directions or "up" and "down".
* "look", "l", or "z" (describes the room to you)
* "examine [object]" or "x [object]"
* "inventory" or "i" (lists your inventory)
* "take [object]" or "take all"
* "drop [object]" or "drop all"
* "give [object]" (to) [person]"
* "cast [Charter spell]"
* "spells" (lists the spells you know)
* "teleport" (sends you back to the Reading Room, or the labyrinth stairs if
    you're in the labyrinth)
* "talk (to) [character]"
* "break [object]" or "cut [object]"
* "read [book]" or "open [book]"
* "shelve [book]"
* "level" (tells you what level you are and what books you've already shelved)
* "exit" or "quit" (exits the game)
* "restart" (restarts the game)

Keep in mind that commands and people names can only be one word, but
direct objects can be more than one. You don't need articles (the, a, an, etc).
