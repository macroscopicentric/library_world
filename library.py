#To do:
#Standardize the command list somehow? The giant if statement seems sloppy. >> verb/noun dictionaries.
#Currently manually entering line breaks. (HP doesn't have line breaks, so breaks at the end of the window,
#often in the middle of a word. Would also need to delete extra spaces if I can do automatic line breaks.)
#Sloppy code, incl. initializations at the bottom and the multiple lists and items dict.
#Bells (item) need to be a recursive so you can call each bell by name.
#Automate descriptions based on paths (ie, like the items are only described in the rooms they're in, if there's a path
#in a specific direction, automatically describe that path).
#Make room states that can change over time (locked doors, etc). Also need to prevent going through the hole at the bottom of the tunnel.
#   Could also use this to create different room descriptions if you get promoted and get a new study, etc.
#NPCs.
#"Alignment" changes due to choices made in dialogue, etc.
#Need to note somewhere that you can use 'human' to change back.
#Add remaining commands to verbs dict.
#Fix labyrinth (secondary cardinal directions and label towers.)

#Bug: couldn't do class Player(object, location) to automatically init the location correctly.
#Bug: bottom code is super sloppy. It was in GameEngine's init, but it complained about variables being defined (global/local issues).
#Bug: since the rooms all call each other, they give errors when other rooms haven't been initialized.
#       Is there a way to initialize without a value, non-descructively?
#       HP solved this by NOT initializing with the paths, but adding them second. (Current workaround.)
#SOLVED: save isn't working. Having the same issue that I was earlier with the item dictionary, where it records an object's
#       location but not its data. (Calling by name gives location, not data.)
#SOLVED: save isn't working. Remembers player's location but not their inventory, and doesn't do anything about items that have been taken/
#moved from their original location.
#SOLVED: #Taking an item puts it in your inventory and removes it from the room, but doesn't change the room description.
#Bug: moving not working since dividing into multiple files. The "self" part of the location is confusing it.
#SOLVED: 'take all' only takes the first two items. Trying 'take all' again then only takes the next one item (in a room with four items).
#(Due to iteration over a changing list. Created a temp list to solve this.)
#Bug: two-word commands throw a fatal error if used without a "noun."
