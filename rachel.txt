S"You're in a long, narrow, dimly-lit room with immensely high\nbookshelves. You think this might be the horror section, as all of the books\nyou can see seem to be about faceless spectres. Tragically, this section of the\nlibrary seems to lack both librarian repellant dispensers and trees. I would\nget out of here as soon as possible if I were you, as you probably don't want\nto meet the librarians in this particular library. There are doors to the north\nand west."

S'You\'re in a long, narrow, dimly-lit room with immensely high\nbookshelves. There are two very old (vintage? decrepit? Pleistocene?\ncarbon-dated?) computers in the corner, with hand-lettered "Out of Order" signs\ntaped to their screens. Tragically, this section of the library seems to lack\nboth librarian repellant dispensers and trees.
